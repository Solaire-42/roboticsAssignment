**Assignment for robotics lecture**

This is a small example for a turtlesim application with edge detection where the turtle randomly moves around, controlled by a C++ code.

To install the application in your ubuntu ROS2 eviroment simply do the following:
1) Clone the repo into your workspace: "git clone https://github.com/Solaire-42/roboticsAssignment.git"
2) Navigate into the directory: "cd roboticsAssignment"
3) Execute the bash file: "bash turtlesimAutomata.sh"

   3.1) Necessary files are copied into your home directory ~

   3.2) Repository will be deleted afterwards

   3.3) Application is build with colcon

   3.4) Application is executed
   
5) Watch the turtle does it's job :-)
